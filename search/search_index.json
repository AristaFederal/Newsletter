However, as the traditional network perimeter disappears\u2014driven by the dynamic placement of applications in the cloud and the adoption of SaaS solutions\u2014organizations now face greater vulnerabilities. The push to offer seamless access to key resources for employees and contractors, often through BYOD policies, further increases this risk. Additionally, many threat actors now employ sophisticated, malware-free techniques that can cause significant damage, even when data is fully encrypted.  </p> <p>Driven by evolving security challenges, Zero Trust has emerged as a top priority for enterprises. As a leading provider of networking solutions to enterprise customers, Arista recognizes that the network itself can be leveraged to enhance enterprise security in innovative and efficient ways\u2014delivering robust protection without adding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a seamless experience for all users and stakeholders. While Zero Trust encompasses a broad range of security domains and requires contributions from various technologies\u2014including firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other security services\u2014the network remains foundational. Every user, device, and application relies on the network to communicate, positioning it as a critical control point for enforcing security policies and enabling real-time visibility and threat response across the enterprise.  </p> <p>  Arista Zero Trust Networking </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Zero Trust architecture is a combination of various functions starting from  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Identity-based adaptive access control: Arista\u2019s AGNI (Arista Guardian Network Identity) system serves as a network access control policy engine that provides access to users and devices no matter where they connect over wired or wireless networks. It can be a policy engine for corporate users, devices, guest users, BYOD, and IoT. It meets the zero-trust requirement of trusting nothing and always knowing the identity of every endpoint. AGNI also helps operators restrict what users or devices can access once they are on the network.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the user\u2019s identity, we can create identity-aware microperimeters that are completely decoupled from the underlying network topology. Arista\u2019s ZTX traffic mapper appliance (physical or virtual) can then monitor all session-level activity in the network and provide the operator a clear view of the communication activity. The operator can create policies based on that identity-aware view.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Multi Domain Microsegmentation Services (Arista MSS) can then enforce the identity-aware segmentation at the network's edge and greatly simplify or limit the need for the firewall to just inter-zone traffic\u2014this kind of identity-aware enforcement further limits lateral movement within the network. Even if someone were to infiltrate the network, Arista MSS would greatly reduce the attacker's ability by restricting movement beyond what is allowed for that group, which is explicitly governed through the policy. Any traffic that does not match the policy is redirected to the firewalls for further inspection.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The native built-in NDR (Network Detection and Response) capability within Arista switches discovers, profiles, and tracks devices, users, and applications using AI-based fingerprinting and detects sophisticated threats with the lowest noise possible. This meets the continuous monitoring requirement of a network built with Zero Trust principles.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>To learn more about Arista\u2019s Zero Trust approach, please visit the following link below: Arista Zero Trust Networking </p>"},{"location":"#the-evolution-of-arista-eos-from-sysdb-to-netdl","title":"The Evolution of Arista EOS: From SysDB to NetDL","text":"<p>By: Frough Taihary &amp; Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region  </p> <p>Arista Networks\u2019 Extensible Operating System (EOS) has been a game-changer in networking, offering a modular, programmable, and highly resilient architecture. Unlike traditional network operating systems, EOS is built on a database-driven model, enabling real-time state streaming and management.    </p> <p>This article explores the evolution of EOS, focusing on its core databases\u2014SysDB, NetDB, and NetDL.  </p> <p>SysDB is the core of a switch that holds the state information of a switch. SysDB, or System Database,  exists in every Arista switch. It stores the state of all 100+ agents, or processes, running on the switch. The agents communicate through a publish and subscribe model to SysDB, therefore agents do not communicate with each other directly but only with SysDB. This prevents agent interdependency and cascading failures within the operating system. Also, by separating agent state from processing, we have created a more resilient and fault tolerant switching architecture. An agent that goes offline simply needs to pull its last known state from SysDB upon re-initilization to begin processing as if no failure occurred. To summarize, SysDB serves as a centralized database within each EOS switch, however, the next evolution of EOS goes beyond a single device.   </p> <p> </p> <p>NetDB is the next evolution of EOS, and it operates by collecting data from all of our Arista EOS switches. NetDB allows us to aggregate all the switches' state information in one location. The evolution from SysDB to NetDB led to the creation of our Network management and orchestration platform CloudVision. While this was a big step forward, we wanted to expand our visibility from EOS devices to now include information from all aspects of our network.   </p> <p>NetDL is the latest evolution of EOS. NetDL is a series of databases that aggregates information from all aspects of our network, not just the switching infrastructure. This can include data from our EOS devices, wireless, security, IoT, Virtualized, and 3rd party infrastructure. This led to the creation of CV-UNO (Universal Network Observability), which ingests all of the additional data into CloudVision, giving the network operator much wider visibility into their entire network. Also, since NetDL provides us with an expansive collection of network data in one location, Arista's AI/ML solution AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) can leverage the data to provide customers with real time remediation recommendations, reducing MTTR.   </p> <p> </p> <p>In conclusion, EOS evolved from a single database located on a single switch, to a network wide database aggregating every switch's state information, to an encompassing series of databases aggregating data from every aspect and interaction within our network.  </p> <p>To learn more, click on the links below: Ken Duda \"EOS: A Tale of Opposite Architectures\" Ken Duda \"Arista NetDL Evolution\" Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

For starters, there can be a wide range of devices deployed in a network, many of which are running various versions of code. Bugs and Security Advisories are unpredictable, and keeping track of them across a wide range of devices and code can become cumbersome. Failing to bring devices into compliance can result in network downtime, outages, and a vulnerable network.   </p> <p>The Compliance Overview section of CloudVision makes managing and maintaining a secure production network simple and straightforward. Once EOS devices are onboarded into CloudVision, they are automatically included in the compliance overview section. CloudVisions Bug and Security Advisory database can be automatically updated by syncing with Arista's AlertBase server within the Settings &gt; Compliance Update section of CloudVision. Once the AlertBase server is synced, you can view any new and existing Bugs and CVE's present on your EOS infrastructure. A table will be auto-populated:    </p> <p>  CloudVision view of bugs </p> <p>  First 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>  Last 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>The table will inform you of the following information:  </p> <ul> <li>The Bug/CVE identifier number</li> <li>A brief summary of the Bug/CVE</li> <li>The associated severity level</li> <li>The total number of affected devices and the exact devices that are affected</li> <li>The version of code that the Bug/CVE was introduced in as well as the version of code that it was fixed in  </li> </ul> <p>Levering this information makes monitoring and maintaining a secure and compliant network a seamless experience. By staying up to date on Bug and Security Advisories affecting devices in your production network, you can avoid network downtime all while ensuring your network is secure. Having one central location to view a list of all affected platforms and the remediation methods for them saves network operators time and energy.   </p> <p>Arista devices use a single operating system, EOS, across all network domains. This further adds to the simplicity of managing and remediating various Bugs and CVE's on our infrastructure, since they are limited to affecting one single operating system instead of many operating systems across devices in various network domains. EOS has historically been, and continues to be, an extremely high quality operating system, as illustrated in the image below.  </p> <p> </p> <p>To learn more about additional features of CloudVisions Compliance Overview section, like image and configuration compliance as well as End of Life information, click on the link below:  </p> <p>CloudVision Compliance Overview </p>"},{"location":"March2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
