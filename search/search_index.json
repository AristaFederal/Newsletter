This allows you to have a full working model of your network, whether you are trying to get a head start on port mapping and configurations, testing out a difficult migration, applying a new set of features, or creating a full digital twin of your existing production network, where you can test changes and designs before applying them to your production environment.   </p> <p>I use ACT on a regular basis, as customers frequently come to me and ask, \u2018How do I migrate from a traditional 3-Tier design to an EVPN/VxLAN CLOS network?\u2019, \u2018How do I set up the routing policy for my Metro Area Network?\u2019, or even, \u2018What is the best way to configure my BGP policies?\u2019. Any number of these situations can easily be modeled with ACT.   </p> <p>Also, given that ACT allows you to specify the device model and have the correct port mapping applied, you are able to get a head start on modeling out your configuration and even your automation, before you ever rack your new Arista Gear. I have worked with many customers, using ACT to create and test the configurations and automation models they have employed in their production environments, which allowed them to build out everything they needed for their deployment, long before the switches arrived. This includes switch configurations, Network Automation Variable Files, for both customer Ansible Scripts and Arista Validated Design (AVD) models, and even integrations with third party services, such DHCP and IPAM (IP Address Management) systems.   </p> <p>Lastly, because you can provision connectivity outside of this virtual environment, you can connect these virtual switches to CVaaS (Arista Cloud Vision as a Service), allowing you to use the same Cloud Vision that you use to manage your other switches, to manage your test environment. This allows you to manage your switches via Cloud Vision, whether that is with Studios, or a different Automation Platform, and view your configuration and changes the same way you will with your switches in your production environment.   </p> <p>Obviously a deep dive into this technology is a rather lengthy article. So in this article, we will cover the \u2018highlights\u2019 of ACT, some basic steps and requirements to get your ACT environment up and running, and show what this looks like in CVaaS.   </p> <p>ACT Setup and Configuration </p> <p>ACT leverages simple YAML files for constructing your device inventory and the connections between the devices. This allows you a simple way to create your lab environment. I love the fact that YAML files are so flexible and easy to read. For someone who is not an automation \u2018expert\u2019 this format is easy for me to work with and understand. I have worked with customers who have never used automation before, but due to the structure of YAML files, they were able to quickly understand how to edit these files and use them in their environment.   </p> <p>Once you have all of your topology file completed, now you simply use that to \u2018create\u2019 your virtual environment and ACT does the rest[^1]. ACT will verify that the topology file is valid and even call out any errors, if they exist. Once the file is validated, you can generate your lab and away you go. The screenshot below shows an example of a lab that I recently built to test out some of the new Campus Studios features for a customer. You can see each of the devices is listed, with the details about the device.  </p> <p>Working with Your Virtual Environment </p> <p>For this lab, I choose to use CVaaS as the way that I would configure and manage my devices. I have an existing CVaaS instance that I use for testing, and adding these devices to my CVaaS instance was exactly the same as I would do for an on-site deployment. Because there are only a few devices in my lab, I choose not to host a ZTP (Zero Touch Provisioning) server, which would have added the security token and the required network information to connect the device to CVaaS automatically. Instead, I choose to do this manually, however, I have used the ZTP method in the past, and it works exactly as it does in a production environment.   </p> <p>In the screenshot below, you can see the Inventory Page from my CVaaS environment. The virtual devices for this lab have been onboarded and you can see them in the inventory, alongside other production, physical devices in my environment. I like to use CVaaS when I am testing features specific to CloudVision as it provides me with the most up to date features and functionality.   </p> Inventory List in CVaaS <p>Again, all of these devices that you see here are virtual devices, running in Cloud Hosted Instance, that you can use to test with. I have done the same or similar work for Data Center Deployments, WAN routing deployments, tests for AVD and other automation frameworks, you name it. The possibilities are endless with ACT. While this example is relatively small and simple, I have built ACT topologies with Customers that literally span 100s of devices, in large 5 Stage CLOS fabrics, with multiple uplinks and dozens of connected end-hosts, all running iPerf and other network testing technologies.   </p> <p>Summary </p> <p>ACT is a very easy to use tool that allows you to test out features, pre-build your network or create a digital twin that you can use to test out changes. It provides you a platform to create extremely large networks, or test out features in a small sandbox, catered to Arista Devices.   </p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about ACT, or would like to speak to someone about ordering this or seeing a live demo, please contact your local account team.  </p> <p>Alternatively, you can also read the following Data Sheet for additional information: ACT Data Sheet </p> <p>[^1]: Virtually all of the \u2018fixed\u2019 switches can be specified, with the correct port mapping applied. It is possible to use Chassis switches as well, but this takes a bit more effort    </p>"},{"location":"#simple-and-straightforward-network-monitoring-arista-connectivity-monitoring-studio","title":"Simple and Straightforward Network Monitoring - Arista Connectivity Monitoring Studio","text":"<p>By: Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region   </p> <p>High latency, packet loss, and jitter are all words we despise as network engineers. We design and build networks to combat and prevent each of those events from happening. However, some things are out of our control and still find a way to occur despite our best efforts. Clients, Endpoints, and Applications are isolated in discrete locations, away from the local network. Managing and determining the performance and user experience of a modern network has proven to be a tough challenge.   </p> <p>The Connectivity Monitor Studio built into Arista CloudVision serves as a simple and straightforward solution to help address this challenge. Connectivity Monitor is a feature introduced in EOS 4.24.2F that aims to allow users to monitor their network resources directly from their Arista switches. It works by periodically sending ICMP probes to designated endpoints, tracking latency, packet loss, jitter, and HTTP response time. An Endpoint can be classified as an EOS device, third-party device, access point, server, or application. As long as ICMP and HTTP ports to these endpoints are open, Connectivity Monitor will be able to track a device's connection to them.  </p> <p>Using the Connectivity Monitor Studio in Arista CloudVision, we define a list of hosts (endpoints) that we would like to track by giving them a name and designating their destination IP address. Then, with the use of device tags, we define an Arista switch (or group of switches) that we will source the ICMP probes from. This can be one of or any number of our Arista EOS switches that have been onboarded into CloudVision. The last step is to simply map the defined hosts to the tagged Arista switch or group of switches we want to source the monitoring from.   </p> Hosts in Connectivity Monitoring Studios <p>CloudVision Studios will then build out the configuration needed for each device that we defined in the Connectivity Monitor Studio. After executing the Change Control, within the Devices tab of CloudVision, under the Connectivity Monitor subsection, we can select any number of our devices and view Latency, Packet Loss, Jitter, and HTTP Response time statistics to the defined hosts.   </p> Latency View <p>For CloudVision as a Service (CVaaS) customers, this information is stored for 30 days. This can greatly aid in troubleshooting network disruptions as we can view historical telemetry data up to 4 weeks in the past. Furthermore, using the Events tab in CloudVIsion, we can set Latency, Packet Loss, Jitter, or HTTP Response Time thresholds that, when breached, send alerts directly to a receiver of our choice. Coupled with the real-time state streaming of EOS, this ensures that we will not miss a single spike in latency or any of the other listed metrics that we are tracking thanks to Connectivity Monitor.    </p> <p>To learn more about Connectivity Monitor and the Connectivity Monitor Studio, click the links below:  </p> <p>Connectivity Monitor Connectivity Monitor Studio Connectivity Monitor TOI </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

However, as the traditional network perimeter disappears\u2014driven by the dynamic placement of applications in the cloud and the adoption of SaaS solutions\u2014organizations now face greater vulnerabilities. The push to offer seamless access to key resources for employees and contractors, often through BYOD policies, further increases this risk. Additionally, many threat actors now employ sophisticated, malware-free techniques that can cause significant damage, even when data is fully encrypted.  </p> <p>Driven by evolving security challenges, Zero Trust has emerged as a top priority for enterprises. As a leading provider of networking solutions to enterprise customers, Arista recognizes that the network itself can be leveraged to enhance enterprise security in innovative and efficient ways\u2014delivering robust protection without adding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a seamless experience for all users and stakeholders. While Zero Trust encompasses a broad range of security domains and requires contributions from various technologies\u2014including firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other security services\u2014the network remains foundational. Every user, device, and application relies on the network to communicate, positioning it as a critical control point for enforcing security policies and enabling real-time visibility and threat response across the enterprise.  </p> <p>  Arista Zero Trust Networking </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Zero Trust architecture is a combination of various functions starting from  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Identity-based adaptive access control: Arista\u2019s AGNI (Arista Guardian Network Identity) system serves as a network access control policy engine that provides access to users and devices no matter where they connect over wired or wireless networks. It can be a policy engine for corporate users, devices, guest users, BYOD, and IoT. It meets the zero-trust requirement of trusting nothing and always knowing the identity of every endpoint. AGNI also helps operators restrict what users or devices can access once they are on the network.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the user\u2019s identity, we can create identity-aware microperimeters that are completely decoupled from the underlying network topology. Arista\u2019s ZTX traffic mapper appliance (physical or virtual) can then monitor all session-level activity in the network and provide the operator a clear view of the communication activity. The operator can create policies based on that identity-aware view.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Multi Domain Microsegmentation Services (Arista MSS) can then enforce the identity-aware segmentation at the network's edge and greatly simplify or limit the need for the firewall to just inter-zone traffic\u2014this kind of identity-aware enforcement further limits lateral movement within the network. Even if someone were to infiltrate the network, Arista MSS would greatly reduce the attacker's ability by restricting movement beyond what is allowed for that group, which is explicitly governed through the policy. Any traffic that does not match the policy is redirected to the firewalls for further inspection.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The native built-in NDR (Network Detection and Response) capability within Arista switches discovers, profiles, and tracks devices, users, and applications using AI-based fingerprinting and detects sophisticated threats with the lowest noise possible. This meets the continuous monitoring requirement of a network built with Zero Trust principles.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>To learn more about Arista\u2019s Zero Trust approach, please visit the following link below: Arista Zero Trust Networking </p>"},{"location":"April2025/#the-evolution-of-arista-eos-from-sysdb-to-netdl","title":"The Evolution of Arista EOS: From SysDB to NetDL","text":"<p>By: Frough Taihary &amp; Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region  </p> <p>Arista Networks\u2019 Extensible Operating System (EOS) has been a game-changer in networking, offering a modular, programmable, and highly resilient architecture. Unlike traditional network operating systems, EOS is built on a database-driven model, enabling real-time state streaming and management.    </p> <p>This article explores the evolution of EOS, focusing on its core databases\u2014SysDB, NetDB, and NetDL.  </p> <p>SysDB is the core of a switch that holds the state information of a switch. SysDB, or System Database,  exists in every Arista switch. It stores the state of all 100+ agents, or processes, running on the switch. The agents communicate through a publish and subscribe model to SysDB, therefore agents do not communicate with each other directly but only with SysDB. This prevents agent interdependency and cascading failures within the operating system. Also, by separating agent state from processing, we have created a more resilient and fault tolerant switching architecture. An agent that goes offline simply needs to pull its last known state from SysDB upon re-initilization to begin processing as if no failure occurred. To summarize, SysDB serves as a centralized database within each EOS switch, however, the next evolution of EOS goes beyond a single device.   </p> <p> </p> <p>NetDB is the next evolution of EOS, and it operates by collecting data from all of our Arista EOS switches. NetDB allows us to aggregate all the switches' state information in one location. The evolution from SysDB to NetDB led to the creation of our Network management and orchestration platform CloudVision. While this was a big step forward, we wanted to expand our visibility from EOS devices to now include information from all aspects of our network.   </p> <p>NetDL is the latest evolution of EOS. NetDL is a series of databases that aggregates information from all aspects of our network, not just the switching infrastructure. This can include data from our EOS devices, wireless, security, IoT, Virtualized, and 3rd party infrastructure. This led to the creation of CV-UNO (Universal Network Observability), which ingests all of the additional data into CloudVision, giving the network operator much wider visibility into their entire network. Also, since NetDL provides us with an expansive collection of network data in one location, Arista's AI/ML solution AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) can leverage the data to provide customers with real time remediation recommendations, reducing MTTR.   </p> <p> </p> <p>In conclusion, EOS evolved from a single database located on a single switch, to a network wide database aggregating every switch's state information, to an encompassing series of databases aggregating data from every aspect and interaction within our network.  </p> <p>To learn more, click on the links below: Ken Duda \"EOS: A Tale of Opposite Architectures\" Ken Duda \"Arista NetDL Evolution\" Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) </p>"},{"location":"April2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

For starters, there can be a wide range of devices deployed in a network, many of which are running various versions of code. Bugs and Security Advisories are unpredictable, and keeping track of them across a wide range of devices and code can become cumbersome. Failing to bring devices into compliance can result in network downtime, outages, and a vulnerable network.   </p> <p>The Compliance Overview section of CloudVision makes managing and maintaining a secure production network simple and straightforward. Once EOS devices are onboarded into CloudVision, they are automatically included in the compliance overview section. CloudVisions Bug and Security Advisory database can be automatically updated by syncing with Arista's AlertBase server within the Settings &gt; Compliance Update section of CloudVision. Once the AlertBase server is synced, you can view any new and existing Bugs and CVE's present on your EOS infrastructure. A table will be auto-populated:    </p> <p>  CloudVision view of bugs </p> <p>  First 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>  Last 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>The table will inform you of the following information:  </p> <ul> <li>The Bug/CVE identifier number</li> <li>A brief summary of the Bug/CVE</li> <li>The associated severity level</li> <li>The total number of affected devices and the exact devices that are affected</li> <li>The version of code that the Bug/CVE was introduced in as well as the version of code that it was fixed in  </li> </ul> <p>Levering this information makes monitoring and maintaining a secure and compliant network a seamless experience. By staying up to date on Bug and Security Advisories affecting devices in your production network, you can avoid network downtime all while ensuring your network is secure. Having one central location to view a list of all affected platforms and the remediation methods for them saves network operators time and energy.   </p> <p>Arista devices use a single operating system, EOS, across all network domains. This further adds to the simplicity of managing and remediating various Bugs and CVE's on our infrastructure, since they are limited to affecting one single operating system instead of many operating systems across devices in various network domains. EOS has historically been, and continues to be, an extremely high quality operating system, as illustrated in the image below.  </p> <p> </p> <p>To learn more about additional features of CloudVisions Compliance Overview section, like image and configuration compliance as well as End of Life information, click on the link below:  </p> <p>CloudVision Compliance Overview </p>"},{"location":"March2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
