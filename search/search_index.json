The careful orchestration of the upgrade timelines ensuring the authorized service interruption window would not impact military operations was complete. We were given a short time to execute a zone-based reboot across the Base Area Network and Data Centers. At first, all was well but during the window we were instructed that the devices need to be back in operation and the maintenance window was canceled. The nine minute reboot could not be expedited and another device came back with the frustrating error outlining corrupted or loss of flash staring at me\u2026 tick tok. </p> <p>While the pressure for your restarts and reboots may not be at the same level or may very well exceed it, Arista Networks provides Smart System Upgrades (SSU) or \u2018Hitless\u2019 upgrades across DataCenter and Campus switching variants which may be one of the most underrated and undervalued capabilities in the Arista arsenal. </p> <p>What is SSU?</p> <p>SSU is a solution suite designed to address some of the most complex and challenging tasks facing network administrators - network appliance maintenance. Changes to the underlying network infrastructure can affect large numbers of devices and cause significant outages. Using the flexibility of Arista design to your advantage, there are multiple variations of SSU at your disposal:  Leaf SSU enables hitless software upgrade that allows a network operator to upgrade the software while keeping the switch data plane operational during the upgrade. Hitless upgrade is completely seamless to connected hosts ensuring uptime to services and applications to singly attached hosts during a software upgrade.  Spine SSU introduces maintenance mode to intelligently insert and remove a spine device from the network by combining protocol based graceful shutdown and traffic redirection hence minimizing loss to application traffic. Maintenance mode enables network operation teams to stay on top of software upgrades, hardware replacements or isolated troubleshooting without taking downtime for applications. Regardless of the network model you are operating, be it a spine-leaf topology, MLAG or other, SSU utilizes Arista\u2019s Extensible Operating System\u2019s (EOS) modular architecture to ensure hitless upgrades (when traffic forwarding continues uninterrupted) is available to you. For details on the EOS construct, design, and history please see the October Federal Newsletter as understanding the distributed state database is paramount to understanding how SSU functions. </p> <p>SSU orchestrates upgrades using a multi-stage process working carefully with SysDB while \u2018siloing\u2019 agents. While silo\u2019ing may have a negative connotation in our lives, in this instance these agents acting independent of one another is used to our advantage because each does not directly impact the other; rather each informs the central SysDB of state changes.</p> <p>Preparation Phase: Validate and confirm the EOS future image and ensure up to date running configurations are saved.  Shutdown: Topology dependent but effectively the re-direction of traffic to MLAG Peers device or maintenance mode for Core spine devices. This traffic re-direction, as applicable, allows for L2 or L3 tables to populate and accept traffic during the upgrade of the primary device.  Accelerated boot: Fast boot technology will skip unnecessary hardware initialization and load the required modules, again, based on type of device, topology, and configuration.  Reconciliation: A graceful restart of configured protocols (OSPF, BGP, etc) allowing for traffic convergence and updates once- not progressive or consecutive state-based update(s). </p> <p>WIFM: What\u2019s in it for me? (you)</p> <p>We have all experienced device reloads with outages and accept it as just a part of doing business. This capability, with the flexibility built-in based on Arista\u2019s EOS and platforms, brings renewed fervor to the planned outage frustration: </p> <ol> <li>Faster reload times: gaining approximately 80% of your time back</li> <li>Hitless upgrades: upgrade during any point of the business day without impacting users</li> <li>Traffic Redirection: Maintenance mode or traffic re-direction minimizes disruptions in multi-device architectures</li> <li>Automation Integration: Use Ansible, Puppet, and Arista\u2019s eAPI</li> <li>Fault Tolerance: If a fault occurs, only that process restarts and only receives the most recent state changes. We leave the rest of the device and its capability alone. </li> <li>Scalable: From a few access devices or massive data center architectures managed via CloudVision, SSU is orchestrated as required by the site admins on their schedule and their capabilities. </li> <li>Uninterrupted connections: By sending LACP link-state information, the network connections remain active which allows traffic to continue to traverse the device</li> <li>Intelligent insertion and removal of network elements, customized to the Spine or the Leaf layer</li> <li>Programmatic interface to tailor upgrades to operating environment</li> </ol> <p>The steps and commands utilized are outlined here, generically. You can also (and we would recommend) using CloudVision to execute SSU to ensure success of each device as it completes the upgrade and reboot process. Arista prides itself in quality and simplicity. </p> <ol> <li>Save the current configuration:      </li> <li>Ensure space is available for new EOS + logs      </li> <li>Verify connectivity for management      </li> <li>Verify configuration supports SSU. Fix errors presented, as required.       </li> <li>For BGP / MP-BGP **Ensure all BGP sessions are stable; for BGP within a specific VRF, use \u2018graceful-restart\u2019 within the respective VRF      </li> <li>For switches using MLAG:       Transfer new EOS image onto device via USB, FTP, SCP, HTTP</li> <li>Prep device to boot from new image EOS would be the version you are upgrading to and wr mem      </li> <li>Reboot the device      </li> <li>Verify new EOS version is utilized      </li> </ol> <p>The dual supervisor version is utilized in nearly the same method; however, there are some nuances with the process of rebooting to be aware of. Namely, that the secondary supervisor receives the image from the primary and both are restarted together. </p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>There is no doubt that the opening scenario will bring back memories for many on the Arista Federal team and our customers as each of us has our own scenario that may mimic it. Only you know the risk level of your environment but with Arista Networks, the frustrating era of 0200 maintenance windows to limit network downtime has now paved the way for day-time reboots with little risk to customers, end-users, and in our world, military operations.</p>"},{"location":"#unlock-the-power-of-programmatic-networking-with-arista-eos-api-eapi","title":"Unlock the Power of Programmatic Networking with Arista EOS API (eAPI)","text":"<p>Mike Reyes, Systems Engineers, Arista Networks Federal </p> <p>In today\u2019s fast-paced data centers, manual configuration via SSH is no longer enough. Network operators need speed, reliability, and seamless integration with modern automation tools. That\u2019s where Arista\u2019s Extensible Operating System (EOS\u00ae) API \u2013 better known as eAPI \u2013 shines as a game-changer for network automation.</p> <p>What Makes eAPI Stand Out?</p> <p>Arista EOS offers multiple programmable interfaces for applications. The applications running on the switch or external EOS applications can leverage these interfaces. For example, Arista\u2019s EOS API (eAPI) interface allows applications and scripts complete programmatic control over EOS with a stable and easy-to-use syntax. Once the API is enabled, the switch accepts commands using Arista\u2019s command line interface (CLI) syntax, and responds with machine-readable output and errors serialized in JSON, served over HTTPS.</p> <p>Here are the three pillars that have made eAPI a favorite among network engineers and DevOps teams worldwide:</p> <ol> <li>Comprehensiveness     With Arista\u2019s eAPI, customers can access any state and configure any properties on the switch that they could otherwise do over the CLI.     Every command available in the CLI is accessible via eAPI. From <code>show interfaces</code> to full configuration sessions (<code>configure terminal</code> \u2192 multiple commands \u2192 <code>end</code>), you get 100% parity with interactive sessions.</li> <li>Ease of Use &amp; Flexibility     The simplicity of this protocol and the availability of third-party JSON clients means that eAPI is language agnostic and can integrate into any existing infrastructure and workflow. Additionally, on-box, interactive documentation for the API and return values make writing new programs simple.<ul> <li>Language-agnostic: Works with Python, Go, Ruby, PowerShell \u2013 any language with an HTTPS client.  </li> <li>Built-in interactive documentation: Just point your browser to <code>https://&lt;switch-ip&gt;/eapi</code> after enabling the service.  </li> <li>On-box API explorer at <code>https://&lt;switch-ip&gt;/eapi/spec</code> lets you test commands live</li> </ul> </li> <li>Rock-Solid Stability     Arista ensures that a command\u2019s structured output will remain compatible with multiple future versions of EOS. The compatibility allows end users to confidently develop critical applications without compromising their ability to upgrade to newer EOS releases and gain additional features. Furthermore, this enables scripts to operate cleanly in data centers running multiple versions of EOS without compromising eAPI\u2019s simplicity.</li> </ol> <p>Arista guarantees backward compatibility of structured output across multiple EOS releases. Upgrade your switches without breaking your automation scripts \u2013 a promise that removes the biggest barrier to adopting new features.</p> EOS Architecture Overview <ul> <li> <p>Clients send an HTTP POST request to the server using the lightweight JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. Requests specify \u00bb The \u201cmethod\u201d to use (at this time, always \u201crunCmds\u201d). \u00bb A list of commands to run, for example [\u2018show interfaces\u2019], or [\u2018configure\u2019, \u2018interface Ethernet 1\u2019, \u2018shutdown\u2019] \u00bb A \u201cversion\u201d number specifying which revision of the model output your script expects (at this time, always \u201c1\u201d).</p> </li> <li> <p>The server processes the request and collects a structured data model for each command, which will then be converted into JSON. The JSON-RPC 2.0 \u2018error\u2019 field is set if a command returns an error. Otherwise, the response is in the \u2018result\u2019 field. You can view further documentation on response formats at https:///eapi/spec and overview documentation at https:///eapi/overview. EOS Command Validation over eAPI and embedded EOS Sanity Checks Command and control over eAPI (configuration change or command execution) can optionally be sent with a validation flag, meaning the CLI command will not be executed on the switch but will be parsed by EOS. This function is leveraged by AVD and CloudVision to ensure a CLI command or configuration change is syntactically correct and supported by the target device the platform it is executed against.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Sanity Check functions embedded in EOS can also be programmatically called to validate a syntactically correct config change is also functionally correct. One example is the MLAG Sanity Check - a CLI command call that triggers EOS to query its neighboring MLAG switch to ensure a proposed config change will not disrupt MLAG functionality.</p> <p>Real-World Applications</p> <p>Imagine replacing an entire running configuration on hundreds of leaf and spine switches in seconds instead of hours or feeding live interface counters directly into your monitoring stack without custom parsers. Customers are already doing this:</p> <ul> <li>Zero-touch provisioning: Push complete configurations in a single API call.  </li> <li>Integration with Ansible, AVD, and Terraform: Official modules and the Arista Validated Designs (AVD) framework make eAPI the backbone of modern data-center-as-code.  </li> <li>Advanced telemetry: Pull structured <code>show</code> command output into Splunk, Elasticsearch, or Grafana with zero transformation effort.</li> </ul> <p>eAPI\u2019s completeness, stability, and ease of use make it well-suited for various customer applications. </p> <p>For example, traditional network configuration workflows involve connecting to nodes over SSH and setting the configuration command by command. eAPI makes this trivial and allows network operators to replace the entire running configuration for a device in one sequence. eAPI reduces the time to deploy a change and gives the operator a quick feedback loop. eAPI excels at integrating with third-party software. </p> <p>For example, retrieving structured JSON data from Arista nodes allows developers and operators to easily incorporate EOS nodes into network automation workflows, monitoring, and data center infrastructure management tools. In addition, another use case is for network administrators who wish to configure many nodes programmatically. The robust ecosystem around eAPI has led to integrations with popular open-source toolings such as Arista\u2019s own Arista Validated Designs (AVD) framework and Red Hat\u2019s Ansible Automation Platform.</p> <p>The Future Is Programmable</p> <p>As networks evolve into software-defined infrastructure, tools like eAPI are no longer nice-to-have \u2013 they are the way forward. With guaranteed stability, universal language support, and complete CLI coverage, Arista eAPI empowers you to automate everything from day-to-day operations to massive greenfield deployments.</p> <p>Ready to leave SSH scripts behind?

However, as the traditional network perimeter disappears\u2014driven by the dynamic placement of applications in the cloud and the adoption of SaaS solutions\u2014organizations now face greater vulnerabilities. The push to offer seamless access to key resources for employees and contractors, often through BYOD policies, further increases this risk. Additionally, many threat actors now employ sophisticated, malware-free techniques that can cause significant damage, even when data is fully encrypted.  </p> <p>Driven by evolving security challenges, Zero Trust has emerged as a top priority for enterprises. As a leading provider of networking solutions to enterprise customers, Arista recognizes that the network itself can be leveraged to enhance enterprise security in innovative and efficient ways\u2014delivering robust protection without adding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a seamless experience for all users and stakeholders. While Zero Trust encompasses a broad range of security domains and requires contributions from various technologies\u2014including firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other security services\u2014the network remains foundational. Every user, device, and application relies on the network to communicate, positioning it as a critical control point for enforcing security policies and enabling real-time visibility and threat response across the enterprise.  </p> <p>  Arista Zero Trust Networking </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Zero Trust architecture is a combination of various functions starting from  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Identity-based adaptive access control: Arista\u2019s AGNI (Arista Guardian Network Identity) system serves as a network access control policy engine that provides access to users and devices no matter where they connect over wired or wireless networks. It can be a policy engine for corporate users, devices, guest users, BYOD, and IoT. It meets the zero-trust requirement of trusting nothing and always knowing the identity of every endpoint. AGNI also helps operators restrict what users or devices can access once they are on the network.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the user\u2019s identity, we can create identity-aware microperimeters that are completely decoupled from the underlying network topology. Arista\u2019s ZTX traffic mapper appliance (physical or virtual) can then monitor all session-level activity in the network and provide the operator a clear view of the communication activity. The operator can create policies based on that identity-aware view.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Multi Domain Microsegmentation Services (Arista MSS) can then enforce the identity-aware segmentation at the network's edge and greatly simplify or limit the need for the firewall to just inter-zone traffic\u2014this kind of identity-aware enforcement further limits lateral movement within the network. Even if someone were to infiltrate the network, Arista MSS would greatly reduce the attacker's ability by restricting movement beyond what is allowed for that group, which is explicitly governed through the policy. Any traffic that does not match the policy is redirected to the firewalls for further inspection.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The native built-in NDR (Network Detection and Response) capability within Arista switches discovers, profiles, and tracks devices, users, and applications using AI-based fingerprinting and detects sophisticated threats with the lowest noise possible. This meets the continuous monitoring requirement of a network built with Zero Trust principles.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>To learn more about Arista\u2019s Zero Trust approach, please visit the following link below: Arista Zero Trust Networking </p>"},{"location":"April2025/#the-evolution-of-arista-eos-from-sysdb-to-netdl","title":"The Evolution of Arista EOS: From SysDB to NetDL","text":"<p>By: Frough Taihary &amp; Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region  </p> <p>Arista Networks\u2019 Extensible Operating System (EOS) has been a game-changer in networking, offering a modular, programmable, and highly resilient architecture. Unlike traditional network operating systems, EOS is built on a database-driven model, enabling real-time state streaming and management.    </p> <p>This article explores the evolution of EOS, focusing on its core databases\u2014SysDB, NetDB, and NetDL.  </p> <p>SysDB is the core of a switch that holds the state information of a switch. SysDB, or System Database,  exists in every Arista switch. It stores the state of all 100+ agents, or processes, running on the switch. The agents communicate through a publish and subscribe model to SysDB, therefore agents do not communicate with each other directly but only with SysDB. This prevents agent interdependency and cascading failures within the operating system. Also, by separating agent state from processing, we have created a more resilient and fault tolerant switching architecture. An agent that goes offline simply needs to pull its last known state from SysDB upon re-initilization to begin processing as if no failure occurred. To summarize, SysDB serves as a centralized database within each EOS switch, however, the next evolution of EOS goes beyond a single device.   </p> <p> </p> <p>NetDB is the next evolution of EOS, and it operates by collecting data from all of our Arista EOS switches. NetDB allows us to aggregate all the switches' state information in one location. The evolution from SysDB to NetDB led to the creation of our Network management and orchestration platform CloudVision. While this was a big step forward, we wanted to expand our visibility from EOS devices to now include information from all aspects of our network.   </p> <p>NetDL is the latest evolution of EOS. NetDL is a series of databases that aggregates information from all aspects of our network, not just the switching infrastructure. This can include data from our EOS devices, wireless, security, IoT, Virtualized, and 3rd party infrastructure. This led to the creation of CV-UNO (Universal Network Observability), which ingests all of the additional data into CloudVision, giving the network operator much wider visibility into their entire network. Also, since NetDL provides us with an expansive collection of network data in one location, Arista's AI/ML solution AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) can leverage the data to provide customers with real time remediation recommendations, reducing MTTR.   </p> <p> </p> <p>In conclusion, EOS evolved from a single database located on a single switch, to a network wide database aggregating every switch's state information, to an encompassing series of databases aggregating data from every aspect and interaction within our network.  </p> <p>To learn more, click on the links below: Ken Duda \"EOS: A Tale of Opposite Architectures\" Ken Duda \"Arista NetDL Evolution\" Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) </p>"},{"location":"April2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

Arista has been the thought leader and pioneer of this leaf-spine cloud network for data centers, and now we can see a seamless extension of this concept to the WAN and inter data center using the same principles that have served our customers. The distribution of applications across AI, cloud, SaaS, edge, and enterprise environments creates new challenges for wide area networking architecture and Internet routing to refine branch and WAN networks. Evolution of WANs in the Agentic AI Wave</p> <p>Today, everything changes all over again. Traditional \u201cwho, what, where, and why\u201d factors are upended for modern WAN connectivity. In the old days, people in remote locations accessed centralized data over the WAN, with SD-WAN introduced to help reduce costs compared to dedicated MPLS circuits. Traffic flows were simple, involving many-to-one conversations from many distributed users to a few centralized data sources.</p> <p>In the new AI era, the concepts of what comprises a user and a site in a WAN have changed fundamentally. The introduction of agentic AI even changes what might be considered a user. In addition to people accessing data on demand, new AI agents will be deployed to access data independently, adapting over time to solve problems and enhance user productivity. WAN sites could be anything going forward, including a laptop or smartphone, a house, an airplane, or any other location on the move. Data and applications, located anywhere, add complexity, whether in a central company data center, the public cloud, or distributed branch office sites.</p> <p>New communication options in the WAN will also drive changes in WAN traffic patterns. Instead of many-to-one conversations, the rise of agentic AI will ensure any-to-any conversations with bi-directional bandwidth utilization. AI agents can be deployed anywhere, including in the public cloud, adding extra layers of complexity to WAN network designs.</p> <p>Arista and VeloCloud Coming Together</p> <p>Today, Arista is taking an important and relevant step to bridge the gap between enterprise and cloud WAN access. We are pleased to announce the acquisition of VeloCloud\u2019s novel WAN portfolio from our partner, Broadcom. The new Arista + VeloCloud combination will provide modern WAN solutions for customers globally. VeloCloud\u2019s secure, AI-optimized cloud WAN portfolio will provide seamless, application-aware solutions to connect customer sites of any type, complementing Arista\u2019s leading data center and campus wired/wireless portfolio.</p> <p>Arista + VeloCloud: Better Together</p> <p>With the completion of the VeloCloud acquisition, our customers will now have rich configuration choices such as leafs/spokes for branch sites. This modern WAN architecture delivers multipathing, encryption, in-band network telemetry, segmentation, application identification, and traffic engineering into a single atomic identifier for WAN hub/spine and spoke/leaf applications. This is a natural and next step for a consistent platform, as shown in the figure below:</p> <p> </p> <p>VeloCloud-SD-WAN-Image</p> <p>\u201cWe have been using Arista and VeloCloud in production environments. The addition of the VeloCloud edge strengthens and scales the enterprise WAN network,\u201d stated Alan Davidson, CIO of Broadcom, a leading and early customer.</p> <p>VeloCloud has been an industry pioneer in secure SD-WAN connectivity, offering Security Service Edge (SSE) functionality for the Cloud WAN and working closely with SASE cloud security partners for the past decade. VeloCloud\u2019s secure WAN heritage complements Arista\u2019s zero trust enterprise for wired and wireless campuses, extending to branches as well. With the combined company, we look forward to delivering end-to-end zero trust networking across WAN and LAN domains.</p> <p>MSP and Branch Offerings</p> <p>The addition of the VeloCloud Edge for Cloud WAN and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) provides a portfolio of platforms with integrated security and wireless options, including both 5G and Wi-Fi, as well as a range of Ethernet ports and speeds for LAN and WAN connectivity. Announced today, brand-new POE-enabled campus switches with 1G, 10G, and 25G ports plus new indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi 7 access points, are the perfect options for customers to outfit branch offices using VeloCloud Cloud WAN products to connect each office back to headquarters using secure application optimization to protect and prioritize important business traffic.</p> <p>VeloCloud products complement Arista\u2019s broad campus wired and wireless product portfolio, as well as Arista\u2019s cloud-native CloudEOS routing stack and EOS-based routing platforms. This combined portfolio will offer customers expanded options and deployment flexibility to meet any global WAN and LAN requirement from client to cloud.</p> <p>The Road Ahead </p> <p>In today\u2019s AI era, customers need more than traditional SD-WAN. WAN silos will no longer be viable, as traffic caused by generative AI in data centers (either on-premise or hosted in the cloud) will increasingly impact the WAN. Arista and VeloCloud share a common vision for client to cloud networking across WAN and LAN domains as evidenced by the recent announcement of Google\u2019s Cloud WAN. This is a fitting example of this trend. We are excited to warmly welcome the Velo family, led by founder and former CEO Sanjay Uppal, as our seventh and largest acquisition to date. Welcome to our cognitive campus/branch offerings that modernize WAN networks!</p>"},{"location":"August2025/#demystifying-ultra-ethernet","title":"Demystifying Ultra Ethernet","text":"<p>By: Tom Emmons and John Peach</p> <p>The Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC), of which Arista is a founding member, is a standards organisation established to enhance Ethernet for the demanding requirements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). Over 100 member companies and 1000 participants have collaborated to evolve Ethernet, leading to the recent publication of its 1.0 specification, which will drive hardware implementations that significantly boost cluster performance.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this blog, we will take a look at the need for Ultra Ethernet and the new capabilities it delivers.</p> <p>Historically, AI/ML clusters have been specialist, independent technology islands. As AI/ML has become business-critical, there is a need for a common technology paradigm that integrates with existing enterprise fiscal, operational, and security frameworks. Ethernet and IP have a proven history of adapting over 50 years, and advanced Ethernet networking solutions, such as Arista's Etherlink\u2122 portfolio, are already the chosen interconnect for the majority of AI accelerators (XPUs).</p> <p>A central element of the UEC's vision is to take Ethernet performance to the next level by reimagining Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) as a native Ethernet application. RDMA is vital for the success of both AI and HPC applications, as it enables systems and processors to directly exchange data at high speed, currently 400 Gbps, with 800 Gbps in the near future. This efficient communication facilitates the distribution of workloads across numerous servers and processors, supporting parallel computation across many thousands of accelerators.</p> <p>RDMA entails high flow rates and synchronized large-volume flows that pose challenges for unoptimized Ethernet networks. Without advanced switching features, large flows created hashing nightmares, requiring almost perfect traffic distribution to prevent congestion. The rapid startup and termination of RDMA flows offered traditional congestion control algorithms little time to react. While enhancements like Arista's Etherlink already substantially improve performance beyond alternative proprietary approaches, the next level of universal optimization necessitates a rethinking of how applications interact with the network.</p> <p>This is where Ultra Ethernet Transport (UET) comes in, designed to make RDMA a native Ethernet application by incorporating new traffic distribution semantics and modern congestion control on top of standard Ethernet and IP layers. UET aims to meet the demands of contemporary and traditional HPC workloads without requiring proprietary infrastructure.</p> <p> </p> <p>Key Aspects of Ultra Ethernet Transport (UET)</p> <p>UET addresses the limitations of traditional RDMA networking from several angles to provide a comprehensive new transport paradigm for both HPC and AI/ML workloads. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the innovations below:</p> Traditional RDM Ultra Ethernet RDMA tunneled over Ethernet Closely coupled API and transport Single cluster scaling in tens of thousands Designed for scaling over 1M endpoints No native security implementation Native highly scalable group-based encryption Requires in order delivery Native support for out-of-order packet delivery Multi-pathing at flow level Per-packet multipathing (spraying) Inefficient go-back-N loss recovery Per-packet loss recovery Coarse congestion management and recovery Fine-grained sender and receiver based congestion control Inflexible network tuning paradigm Semantic-level configuration of workload tuning <p>Native Libraries: To achieve maximum performance, UET effectively implements a native transport layer for the ubiquitous libfabric 2.0 API. For many applications, the transition to UET is straightforward, requiring minimal or no application changes.</p> <p>Optimized Traffic Forwarding: A fundamental concept of UET is the evolution from traditional flow-based traffic distribution to source-based packet spraying. Unlike proprietary solutions, UET is built from the ground up for packet spraying for all message types, ensuring optimal efficiency at every layer.</p> <p>Advanced Connection and Congestion Management: Traditional methods of setting up new connections (e.g., 3-way handshake) are time and resource intensive. Congestion algorithms are optimized for general traffic patterns and recovering from packet loss triggers inefficient \"go-back-N\" operations, which require many packets to be resent, impacting both the sender and the receiver, as well as the network itself. UET provides significant optimization for all of these cases, including:</p> <ul> <li>Ephemeral Connections: Enable fast connection startup, eliminating the round-trip handshake delay before data begins to flow.</li> <li>Selective Retransmission: Enables retransmission of individual lost packets, reducing the network-wide impact of a dropped packet from full round-trip time to a single packet.</li> <li>Packet Trimming: Efficiently notifies both receiver and sender of packet loss and congestion, allowing rapid mitigation and recovery.</li> <li>Network Signal Congestion Control (NSCC): Sender-based algorithm that paces transmission rates upon detecting congestion.</li> <li>Receiver Credit Congestion Control (RCCC): Receiver-based mechanism to manage \"in-cast\" scenarios by controlling sender traffic rates.</li> </ul> <p>Security: Given the value of AI models and intellectual property, security of data in-flight is mandatory, especially in multi-tenant environments. UET treats security as a fundamental objective, offering optional end-to-end encryption and authentication based on an advanced group keying scheme that allows all members of a job (e.g., all XPUs for one tenant) to operate in an encrypted bubble, protecting model data from exposure and preventing data injection or exfiltration by other tenants on the network.</p> <p>In summary, the UEC specification modernises the relationship between AI/HPC applications and networks. By tightly integrating application semantics with network behaviours, it creates a native transport mechanism that combines the strengths of RDMA with best-in-class Ethernet solutions, forming a powerful foundation for the next generation of applications.</p> <p> </p> <p>Arista, as the leading provider of advanced Ethernet solutions for AI/ML clusters and a founding member of the UEC, is committed to this vision. With its current Etherlink portfolio already being UET-ready, and ongoing efforts to develop future systems and collaborate with other pioneers to build optimal Ethernet networks for high-performance computing, we look forward to cementing the leadership of Ethernet as a universal interconnect.

After waiting for shipment, scheduling the team to rack the switches, and allocating space in your environment, you can now start to use the switch. However, there are some checklist items that we need to take into consideration to prevent problems from arising. Poor preparation leads to poor execution, and as an Advanced Service Engineer that has seen problems occur, it\u2019s best to have some action items taken care of early on. Listed below are 4 best practices to use during the initial onboarding of your devices. In addition, we have also included 4 crucial steps you should avoid in order to execute the onboarding process to perfection with the least amount of trouble.   </p> <p>Do List:</p> <ol> <li>If using Zero Touch Provisioning, please set up Option 66 and 67 on your DHCP Server:     To enable ZTP for initial onboarding, it is required to enable options 66 and 67 within your DHCP server for the Arista switches to grab a configuration file. Note that if you are running EOS version 4.30.X and above, this requirement is not necessary. The purpose of ZTP is to have a pre-set configuration installed onto your switch. In addition, the next step is to check for reachability to Arista.io   </li> <li>Ensure that you have the proper length rack mounts:   Sometimes we are busy with discussion of architecture, so busy that in fact we glance over some detail that might seem obvious. Upon arrival of your device, ensure that the proper rack equipment is ready to hold the switches in place. If a custom rack mount is needed, your fellow SE would be more than happy to find one for you.  </li> <li>Determine method of device management:     Depending on your choice of either in band or out of band management, it is best practice to have that decision made before the devices are set up. One of the final steps to ensure that onboarding is complete is for the device to reach out to your cloud tenant instance on https://arista.io. Open port 443 to gain reachability to https://arista.io if using CloudVision as a Service (CVaaS). </li> <li>Create a Port Map for device connectivity:   Time saving step here. Wiring devices together seems easy, until you realize the distance between devices are far apart or that the port speed is not what you had expected. Save time by creating a design or port mapping sheet to quickly wire devices together.    </li> </ol> <p>Do NOT:</p> <ol> <li>Do not wait last minute to see if your CVP instance is set up:    As your equipment arrives, it\u2019s best practice to begin communicating with the Account Manager to check for your CVP instance. If it\u2019s not ready, and your equipment arrives, this may add additional time to your plans for onboarding the devices to use CVP.  </li> <li>Do not wait to build configurations for the device, as they begin to onboard:   Having at least an idea of the features and protocols to use prior to the device\u2019s arrival is crucial. Without having a set plan, or even discussing the protocols to use, will add more time to setting up your network. If there is a set deadline, this should be a high priority. It\u2019s best to have this set up as the devices ship over, even better when talking to your SE representative to have questions answered faster.  </li> <li>Do not forget to check transceiver and optic bandwidth capabilities:   This is one of those steps that we might overlook because we are sure the fibers and optics will work together\u2026.until it doesn\u2019t. Mismatch speeds and troubleshooting Layer 1 problems take longer than anticipated since there are many sources of truth for the issue.   </li> </ol> <p>If you\u2019re able to limit the amount of time it takes to troubleshoot the matter because you had prepared ahead of time, wouldn\u2019t your future self thank you for that? Of course, at Arista we have teams that help with the onboarding process, along with SE\u2019s that check to see if the essential fundamentals of your networks are ready for production. If there\u2019s any questions regarding the onboarding process of your new devices, please ask and we would be happy to help!  </p> <p>Additional tips here, click the links below: Tips and Tricks </p>"},{"location":"August2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

This allows you to have a full working model of your network, whether you are trying to get a head start on port mapping and configurations, testing out a difficult migration, applying a new set of features, or creating a full digital twin of your existing production network, where you can test changes and designs before applying them to your production environment.   </p> <p>I use ACT on a regular basis, as customers frequently come to me and ask, \u2018How do I migrate from a traditional 3-Tier design to an EVPN/VxLAN CLOS network?\u2019, \u2018How do I set up the routing policy for my Metro Area Network?\u2019, or even, \u2018What is the best way to configure my BGP policies?\u2019. Any number of these situations can easily be modeled with ACT.   </p> <p>Also, given that ACT allows you to specify the device model and have the correct port mapping applied, you are able to get a head start on modeling out your configuration and even your automation, before you ever rack your new Arista Gear. I have worked with many customers, using ACT to create and test the configurations and automation models they have employed in their production environments, which allowed them to build out everything they needed for their deployment, long before the switches arrived. This includes switch configurations, Network Automation Variable Files, for both customer Ansible Scripts and Arista Validated Design (AVD) models, and even integrations with third party services, such DHCP and IPAM (IP Address Management) systems.   </p> <p>Lastly, because you can provision connectivity outside of this virtual environment, you can connect these virtual switches to CVaaS (Arista Cloud Vision as a Service), allowing you to use the same Cloud Vision that you use to manage your other switches, to manage your test environment. This allows you to manage your switches via Cloud Vision, whether that is with Studios, or a different Automation Platform, and view your configuration and changes the same way you will with your switches in your production environment.   </p> <p>Obviously a deep dive into this technology is a rather lengthy article. So in this article, we will cover the \u2018highlights\u2019 of ACT, some basic steps and requirements to get your ACT environment up and running, and show what this looks like in CVaaS.   </p> <p>ACT Setup and Configuration </p> <p>ACT leverages simple YAML files for constructing your device inventory and the connections between the devices. This allows you a simple way to create your lab environment. I love the fact that YAML files are so flexible and easy to read. For someone who is not an automation \u2018expert\u2019 this format is easy for me to work with and understand. I have worked with customers who have never used automation before, but due to the structure of YAML files, they were able to quickly understand how to edit these files and use them in their environment.   </p> <p>Once you have all of your topology file completed, now you simply use that to \u2018create\u2019 your virtual environment and ACT does the rest[^1]. ACT will verify that the topology file is valid and even call out any errors, if they exist. Once the file is validated, you can generate your lab and away you go. The screenshot below shows an example of a lab that I recently built to test out some of the new Campus Studios features for a customer. You can see each of the devices is listed, with the details about the device.  </p> <p>Working with Your Virtual Environment </p> <p>For this lab, I choose to use CVaaS as the way that I would configure and manage my devices. I have an existing CVaaS instance that I use for testing, and adding these devices to my CVaaS instance was exactly the same as I would do for an on-site deployment. Because there are only a few devices in my lab, I choose not to host a ZTP (Zero Touch Provisioning) server, which would have added the security token and the required network information to connect the device to CVaaS automatically. Instead, I choose to do this manually, however, I have used the ZTP method in the past, and it works exactly as it does in a production environment.   </p> <p>In the screenshot below, you can see the Inventory Page from my CVaaS environment. The virtual devices for this lab have been onboarded and you can see them in the inventory, alongside other production, physical devices in my environment. I like to use CVaaS when I am testing features specific to CloudVision as it provides me with the most up to date features and functionality.   </p> Inventory List in CVaaS <p>Again, all of these devices that you see here are virtual devices, running in Cloud Hosted Instance, that you can use to test with. I have done the same or similar work for Data Center Deployments, WAN routing deployments, tests for AVD and other automation frameworks, you name it. The possibilities are endless with ACT. While this example is relatively small and simple, I have built ACT topologies with Customers that literally span 100s of devices, in large 5 Stage CLOS fabrics, with multiple uplinks and dozens of connected end-hosts, all running iPerf and other network testing technologies.   </p> <p>Summary </p> <p>ACT is a very easy to use tool that allows you to test out features, pre-build your network or create a digital twin that you can use to test out changes. It provides you a platform to create extremely large networks, or test out features in a small sandbox, catered to Arista Devices.   </p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about ACT, or would like to speak to someone about ordering this or seeing a live demo, please contact your local account team.  </p> <p>Alternatively, you can also read the following Data Sheet for additional information: ACT Data Sheet </p> <p>[^1]: Virtually all of the \u2018fixed\u2019 switches can be specified, with the correct port mapping applied. It is possible to use Chassis switches as well, but this takes a bit more effort    </p>"},{"location":"June2025/#simple-and-straightforward-network-monitoring-arista-connectivity-monitoring-studio","title":"Simple and Straightforward Network Monitoring - Arista Connectivity Monitoring Studio","text":"<p>By: Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region   </p> <p>High latency, packet loss, and jitter are all words we despise as network engineers. We design and build networks to combat and prevent each of those events from happening. However, some things are out of our control and still find a way to occur despite our best efforts. Clients, Endpoints, and Applications are isolated in discrete locations, away from the local network. Managing and determining the performance and user experience of a modern network has proven to be a tough challenge.   </p> <p>The Connectivity Monitor Studio built into Arista CloudVision serves as a simple and straightforward solution to help address this challenge. Connectivity Monitor is a feature introduced in EOS 4.24.2F that aims to allow users to monitor their network resources directly from their Arista switches. It works by periodically sending ICMP probes to designated endpoints, tracking latency, packet loss, jitter, and HTTP response time. An Endpoint can be classified as an EOS device, third-party device, access point, server, or application. As long as ICMP and HTTP ports to these endpoints are open, Connectivity Monitor will be able to track a device's connection to them.  </p> <p>Using the Connectivity Monitor Studio in Arista CloudVision, we define a list of hosts (endpoints) that we would like to track by giving them a name and designating their destination IP address. Then, with the use of device tags, we define an Arista switch (or group of switches) that we will source the ICMP probes from. This can be one of or any number of our Arista EOS switches that have been onboarded into CloudVision. The last step is to simply map the defined hosts to the tagged Arista switch or group of switches we want to source the monitoring from.   </p> Hosts in Connectivity Monitoring Studios <p>CloudVision Studios will then build out the configuration needed for each device that we defined in the Connectivity Monitor Studio. After executing the Change Control, within the Devices tab of CloudVision, under the Connectivity Monitor subsection, we can select any number of our devices and view Latency, Packet Loss, Jitter, and HTTP Response time statistics to the defined hosts.   </p> Latency View <p>For CloudVision as a Service (CVaaS) customers, this information is stored for 30 days. This can greatly aid in troubleshooting network disruptions as we can view historical telemetry data up to 4 weeks in the past. Furthermore, using the Events tab in CloudVIsion, we can set Latency, Packet Loss, Jitter, or HTTP Response Time thresholds that, when breached, send alerts directly to a receiver of our choice. Coupled with the real-time state streaming of EOS, this ensures that we will not miss a single spike in latency or any of the other listed metrics that we are tracking thanks to Connectivity Monitor.    </p> <p>To learn more about Connectivity Monitor and the Connectivity Monitor Studio, click the links below:  </p> <p>Connectivity Monitor Connectivity Monitor Studio Connectivity Monitor TOI </p>"},{"location":"June2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

For starters, there can be a wide range of devices deployed in a network, many of which are running various versions of code. Bugs and Security Advisories are unpredictable, and keeping track of them across a wide range of devices and code can become cumbersome. Failing to bring devices into compliance can result in network downtime, outages, and a vulnerable network.   </p> <p>The Compliance Overview section of CloudVision makes managing and maintaining a secure production network simple and straightforward. Once EOS devices are onboarded into CloudVision, they are automatically included in the compliance overview section. CloudVisions Bug and Security Advisory database can be automatically updated by syncing with Arista's AlertBase server within the Settings &gt; Compliance Update section of CloudVision. Once the AlertBase server is synced, you can view any new and existing Bugs and CVE's present on your EOS infrastructure. A table will be auto-populated:    </p> <p>  CloudVision view of bugs </p> <p>  First 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>  Last 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>The table will inform you of the following information:  </p> <ul> <li>The Bug/CVE identifier number</li> <li>A brief summary of the Bug/CVE</li> <li>The associated severity level</li> <li>The total number of affected devices and the exact devices that are affected</li> <li>The version of code that the Bug/CVE was introduced in as well as the version of code that it was fixed in  </li> </ul> <p>Levering this information makes monitoring and maintaining a secure and compliant network a seamless experience. By staying up to date on Bug and Security Advisories affecting devices in your production network, you can avoid network downtime all while ensuring your network is secure. Having one central location to view a list of all affected platforms and the remediation methods for them saves network operators time and energy.   </p> <p>Arista devices use a single operating system, EOS, across all network domains. This further adds to the simplicity of managing and remediating various Bugs and CVE's on our infrastructure, since they are limited to affecting one single operating system instead of many operating systems across devices in various network domains. EOS has historically been, and continues to be, an extremely high quality operating system, as illustrated in the image below.  </p> <p> </p> <p>To learn more about additional features of CloudVisions Compliance Overview section, like image and configuration compliance as well as End of Life information, click on the link below:  </p> <p>CloudVision Compliance Overview </p>"},{"location":"March2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

Unlike traditional monolithic network operating systems, EOS is built from the ground up with modern software engineering principles, emphasizing modularity, programmability, and operational simplicity.</p> <p>At its core, EOS is designed to address the limitations of legacy network operating systems that struggle with the demands of modern data center and cloud networking environments. These environments require rapid deployment, automated operations, and the ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements.</p> <p>Key Design Principles</p> <ul> <li>State-oriented: All network state is centralized and consistent</li> <li>Event-driven: Components react to state changes in real-time</li> <li>Modular: Independent agents handle specific functions</li> <li>Programmable: Extensive APIs enable automation and integration</li> </ul> <p>Core Architecture Overview</p> <p>The Arista EOS architecture is fundamentally different from traditional network operating systems. Instead of a monolithic design where all networking functions are tightly coupled, EOS employs a distributed, agent-based architecture centered around a unified system database (SysDB).</p> <p>This architecture provides several key advantages:</p> <ul> <li>Fault Isolation: Agent failures don't cascade to other system components</li> <li>Independent Development: Agents can be developed, tested, and updated independently</li> <li>Consistent State: All system state is maintained in a single, authoritative database</li> <li>Event-Driven Operations: Changes propagate automatically through the system</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>This architecture provides several key advantages:</p> <ul> <li>Fault Isolation: Agent failures don't cascade to other system components</li> <li>Independent Development: Agents can be developed, tested, and updated independently</li> <li>Consistent State: All system state is maintained in a single, authoritative database</li> <li>Event-Driven Operations: Changes propagate automatically through the system</li> </ul> <p>Key System Components</p> <p>EOS consists of several critical components that work together to provide comprehensive networking functionality. Understanding these components is essential to appreciating the system's design and capabilities.</p> <p> </p> <p>SysDB - The Central Database</p> <p>The System Database (SysDB) is the heart of the EOS architecture. It serves as the single source of truth for all system state, configuration, and operational data. This centralized approach ensures consistency across all system components and enables powerful features like transactional updates and event notifications.</p> <p>Key Characteristics</p> <ul> <li>In-memory database: Optimized for fast access and updates</li> <li>Hierarchical structure: Organized as a tree of interconnected tables</li> <li>ACID transactions: Ensures data consistency during updates</li> <li>Event notifications: Automatic updates when data changes</li> <li>Persistent storage: Critical data survives system restarts</li> </ul> <p>Example: BGP Route Processing</p> <p>When a BGP route is received, the BGP agent updates the SysDB routing table. This automatically triggers notifications to the FIB agent, which programs the hardware forwarding tables, and to any monitoring applications subscribed to routing changes.</p> <p>Agent-Based Architecture</p> <p>Agents are independent processes that implement specific networking functions. Each agent is responsible for a particular aspect of network operation, such as routing protocols, link aggregation, or network monitoring. This modular approach provides numerous benefits over monolithic designs.</p> <p>The agent-based design enables several key capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Stateless Restart: Agents can restart without losing system state</li> <li>Independent Updates: Individual agents can be updated without system downtime</li> <li>Resource Isolation: Memory and CPU usage are isolated per agent</li> <li>Debugging Simplification: Issues can be isolated to specific agents</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>The agent-based design enables several key capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Stateless Restart: Agents can restart without losing system state</li> <li>Independent Updates: Individual agents can be updated without system downtime</li> <li>Resource Isolation: Memory and CPU usage are isolated per agent</li> <li>Debugging Simplification: Issues can be isolated to specific agents</li> </ul> <p>APIs and Programmability</p> <p>One of EOS's most significant advantages is its comprehensive programmability. The system provides multiple APIs and interfaces that enable automation, integration, and custom application development.</p> <p> </p> <p>Advanced Features</p> <p>EOS includes numerous advanced features that distinguish it from traditional network operating systems. These features are enabled by the underlying architecture and provide significant operational benefits.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Benefits and Use Cases The architectural decisions in EOS deliver tangible benefits across various deployment scenarios. These benefits make EOS particularly well-suited for modern data center and cloud networking environments.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Arista EOS represents a significant evolution in network operating system design, moving beyond the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures to embrace modern software engineering principles. The agent-based architecture, centralized state management through SysDB, and comprehensive programmability provide a robust foundation for modern networking requirements.</p> <p>The benefits of this architecture extend beyond technical capabilities to deliver real operational advantages: reduced downtime, simplified troubleshooting, enhanced automation capabilities, and improved network visibility. These advantages make EOS particularly well-suited for environments where network reliability, performance, and operational efficiency are critical.</p> <p>Looking Forward</p> <p>As network requirements continue to evolve with trends like edge computing, 5G, and IoT, the architectural principles embodied in EOS provide a solid foundation for addressing future challenges. The system's modularity and programmability ensure that it can adapt to new requirements while maintaining the stability and performance that modern networks demand.</p> <p>For network engineers and architects evaluating modern networking solutions, understanding EOS architecture provides valuable insights into how contemporary network operating systems can address the challenges of today's dynamic, high-performance networking environments.</p>"},{"location":"October2025/#simplifying-campus-network-operations-with-cloudvision-network-hierarchy","title":"Simplifying Campus Network Operations with CloudVision Network Hierarchy","text":"<p>By: Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region    </p> <p>Managing modern campus networks can prove to be a challenging task that can feel overwhelming at times. Campus networks encompass large numbers of remote sites, each with unique characteristics and various devices to manage. In order to simplify the management of such a distributed infrastructure, Arista has introduced Network Hierarchy in CloudVision.     </p> <p>Overseeing such a deployment and gaining visibility into various sites and device connections is a difficult task to accomplish. When an issue arises, locating that issue and pinpointing it to a specific site can be an extremely difficult task. Configuration across sites can also be difficult to standardize and modify when needed.  </p> <p>Network Hierarchy is a feature meant to simplify campus network management, and was introduced to Arista CloudVision to help address these pain points at scale.  </p> <p>Network Hierarchy in CloudVision provides a logical, tree-like structured view that allows you to group devices together by location. Instead of a linear list of devices that are scattered across your infrastructure, Network Hierarchy provides an organized, simple to comprehend view that allows you to navigate seamlessly between campus networks that you manage using the tree-like structured navigation panel. This structure works at scale, making it easy to oversee and manage large deployments with many physical locations. Each Campus is organized within the hierarchy, with devices grouped by physical location and operational use.  </p> Network Hierarchy Page <p>Within each Campus defined in Network Hierarchy, statistics and metrics are displayed that provide a comprehensive overview tailored to what is happening at each individual site. Metrics include statistics from both the wired and wireless side, Uplink health, MLAG Status, authentication information, connectivity monitor status, and a logical topology view of the Campus network.  This allows operators to quickly go from a global, network wide view, to a site/device specific, interface specific, drilled down view. Having this flexibility allows for faster MTTR, as issues are able to be isolated far more quickly and efficiently. Operators can locate issues that are specific to a site, and from there drill down to determine the exact device or devices experiencing the issues.  </p> Network Hierarchy Port Specific View <p>Network Hierarchy also allows for access layer interface configuration via the Access Interface Configuration Quick Action in CloudVIsion. Here, the operator can rapidly assign access layer port configuration to individual or groups of interfaces. This further simplifies day 2 operations, as any campus device switchport configuration can be viewed and modified as needed, all from the Network Hierarchy view.  </p> <p>To learn more about Network Hierarchy, the metrics it provides, how to run diagnostics, and how it can simplify your Campus network management, click the link below.

If you\u2019re looking for the classic OSPF formula (cost = reference_bandwidth / interface_bandwidth), EOS doesn\u2019t apply it by default and interfaces typically show a cost of 10 until you set a modern reference bandwidth or explicit per-interface costs.</p> <p>Why it happens</p> <ul> <li> <p>Classic OSPF uses a reference bandwidth (historically 100 Mbps).

However, as enterprise and service provider networks evolve toward cloud-native, software-defined (SDN), and virtualization-driven architectures, traditional MPLS pseudowire, Layer 2 (VPLS) and Layer 3 VPN (IP-VPN) services increasingly reveal their limitations. Ethernet VPN (EVPN) has emerged as the modern control plane that not only replaces legacy MPLS services but also enhances scalability, flexibility, and operational simplicity across data center, WAN, and campus environments.</p> <p>Traditional MPLS VPNs, whether pseudowire, IP-VPN or VPLS, use a combination of LDP and BGP to build forwarding tables and isolate customer traffic. While robust, these technologies were designed for static, service-provider-centric environments and lack the simplificity and efficiency required in cloud-scale networks.</p> <p>EVPN redefines this approach by using BGP as a unified control plane for pseudowire, Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services. It introduces a route-type framework that enables MAC and IP information to be distributed efficiently, reducing flooding and improving convergence.</p> Route-Type Name Description 1 Ethernet Auto-Discovery (AD) route Remote discovery of dual-homed segments --- --- --- 2 MAC/Host IP route Locally learned MAC address and Host IP address --- --- --- 3 Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag (IMET) Route EVI membership advertisement --- --- --- 4 Ethernet Segment Route Discover Ethernet Segment peers --- --- --- 5 IP Prefix Route IP prefix advertisement --- --- --- <p>The following are the key benefits of EVPN over legacy MPLS VPN services:</p> <ul> <li>Control Plane MAC Address Learning</li> </ul> <p>MAC address learning is accomplished through the control plane using BGP, rather than through VPLS' flood-and-learn mechanism across the data plane. MAC moves and changes are no longer dependent on aging timers and flooding. EVPN's use of BGP provides near-real time updates and faster convergence.</p> <ul> <li>Multi-Tenancy Support</li> </ul> <p>EVPN provides multi-tenant support by using BGP as a unified control plane to carry both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN information. Each tenant is assigned a unique EVPN Instance (EVI) identified by a Route Distinguisher (RD) and Route Target (RT), ensuring complete isolation of control and data planes. IP Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances are used to isolate each tenant's routed domain, while MAC VRFs provide tenants their own isolated Ethernet domain. EVPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) permits seamless Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity for each tenant. Traffic for each tenant is encapsulated with distinct MPLS service labels, allowing multiple tenants to share the same physical infrastructure while keeping their traffic isolated from each other.</p> <ul> <li>Unified Control Plane</li> </ul> <p>The complexity of multiple BGP address families and LDP signaling is no longer required to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 services. EVPN consolidates Layer 2 and Layer 3 services into a single control plane by using the Route Types for address advertisements. This simplification reduces operational overhead and streamlines service deployment.</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Transport Independent</li> </ul> <p>EVPN is transport agnostic, supporting both MPLS and VXLAN data planes. Multi-tenant Layer 2 and Layer 3 service offerings can span both environments under a shared control plane. This is especially valuable when VXLAN-based data centers are interconnected over a MPLS WAN.</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Load Balancing &amp; Availability</li> </ul> <p>EVPN supports Active-Active Multihoming with Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI). Clients may connect to multiple PEs that are members of the same ESI for improved availability. EVPN advertises ESI membership, enabling Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) from the remote PEs. The Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism identifies the receiving PE for BUM traffic per ESI, ensuring loop-free redundancy and load balancing.</p> <ul> <li>Multicast Support</li> </ul> <p>EVPN enhances multicast functionality using dedicated route types to control group membership and replication. In MPLS environments, Route Types 3, 6, 7, and 8 are used for multicast group signaling and selective replication. Route Type 10 applies to VXLAN environments for optimized overlay multicast group to underlay multicast group mapping.</p> Route-Type Name Description 6 IGMP &amp; MLD Proxy route Advertise and proxy local IGMP joins/leaves --- --- --- 7 IGMP/MLD Join Sync route Advertise/sync local IGMP Join in multi-home topology --- --- --- 8 IGMP/MLD Leave Sync route Advertise/sync local IGMP Leave in multi-home topology --- --- --- 10 S-PMSI-AD route Overlay to Underlay multicast group mapping (VXLAN) --- --- --- <ul> <li>Standards Based</li> </ul> <p>EVPN is a standards-based (RFC 7432) technology with broad multi-vendor interoperability verified across leading networking vendors. EVPN ensures open, future-proof architectures and eliminates the potential for vendor lock-in.</p> <ul> <li>Migration Ready</li> </ul> <p>As VXLAN adoption expands across campus, data center, and WAN environments, EVPN simplifies migration from MPLS to VXLAN. Its shared control plane allows operators to deploy both transports simultaneously, enabling a phased, non-disruptive transition.</p> <p>While MPLS remains a viable transport option, traditional Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services are increasingly inefficient and operationally complex. EVPN provides a transport-independent, unified control plane that delivers these services more efficiently, while allowing seamless coexistence and gradual migration from IP VPN and VPLS to EVPN-based services.</p>"},{"location":"draft/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
